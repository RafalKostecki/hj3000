# hj3000

HIPER JUMPER 3000 is the next version of HIPER JUMPER 2000. HJ3k is created in JavaScript, Electron and LESS. In this version I wanted to use each elements of current ECMAScript standards and compare it to HJ2k where I wanted to use only elements that are native supported in the browser."
